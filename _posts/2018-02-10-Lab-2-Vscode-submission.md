Visual Studio Code is a amazing program with great extentions! It is further advanced by also being open source and editable! Visual Studio Code abstracts from the the orignal Visual Studio by being smaller and more portable while still maintaining the aesthetic of a powerful editor.

Unfortunatly during my time with it I was barely able to launch it. However through numerous attempts I was able to get it to launch with the package installer. This meaning now extentions

check out vsCode project 
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)

I need to do more research to get vsCode correctly launched on windows, but for now it functionally works alright as just an editor without extentions.
