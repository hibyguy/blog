For my release 2 (which I actually did in reverse)

I can't say I learned a lot of new concepts on this lab but I did improve my skils with npm(with my use of suncalc) packages in the code.

The technologies I used were fairly simple, I added an new switch to the intialization which allowed it to process the current time in perspective of your longlatude and latitude and predict the amount of sunlight. Using this i can have the program ask the time of day then change the UI to better suit the eyes for the time(night time dark UI day time light UI).

First, what I did was understand your code base. Second, I was asked you a bunch of questions on how to get started.

# Changes:

## Addition of time logic

{% include gallery caption="" %}

## If statement:

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="" %}
