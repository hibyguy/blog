# Intro
Writing my first issue fix was alot of fun! I did so on the opensouce project Jnes built in react!

# Overview
In this blog post I'm going to go over my decision process and patterns I make when choosing a project then a bug

# Breakdown
At first looking for a repo for me was daunting; I had never done it before. The thought in my head was clear, I needed a repo that was both interesting to me but also had enough bugs for me to do that weren't nesscessarily impossible for me to do. So, I settled on the [Jnes](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes) a classic NES emulator project built in react by [Ben Firshman](https://github.com/bfirsh).

I looked through his bugs and found one I could possibly do; "a two player control scheme implementation" I thought sounds fun, the fun stopped there. I was then thrown right into his code, clearly composed of industry level patterns and thinking; I had to be like him. So I started watching a bunch of tutorials on react to somewhat get up to speed with his ways of programming. once i was done that I worked on my actual implementation. Surprisingly, it wasn't crazy hard but it did take a bit of time and many different tries and approaches.
